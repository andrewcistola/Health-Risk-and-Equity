abstract = {This paper describes forms of risk sharing between insurers and the regulator in a competitive individual health insurance market with imperfectly risk-adjusted capitation payments. Risk sharing implies a reduction of an insurer's incentives for selection as well as for efficiency. In a theoretical analysis, we show how the optimal extent of risk sharing may depend on the weights the regulator assigns to these effects. Some countries employ outlier or proportional risk sharing as a supplement to demographic capitation payments. Our empirical results strongly suggest that other forms of risk sharing yield better tradeoffs between selection and efficiency.}

We show that if physicians undervalue benefits to patients relative to hospital profits, prospective payment, a system in which hospitals receive a payment dependent on the diagnosis-related group within which a patient falls, can lead to too few services being provided. In contrast, a \textquoteleftcost-based\textquoteright reimbursement system is shown to result in too many services being provided. Competition between hospitals for physicians will tend to augment both of these problems. We also examine a mixed reimbursement system, in which hospital reimbursements are paid partly prospectively and partly cost-based. This system is shown under a variety of circumstances to be superior to the other two reimbursement systems by improving the incentives for the efficient level of services, reducing incentives to unnecessarily admit or reclassify patients, and reducing risk to providers.}

A specification using backward myopic prices gives more plausible and stable results than using forward myopic prices. Using 171 million person-months spanning 73 employers from 2008 to 2014, we estimate that the overall demand elasticity by backward myopic consumers is -0.44, with higher elasticities of demand for pharmaceuticals (-0.44), specialists visits (-0.32), {MRIs} (-0.29) and mental health/substance abuse (-0.26), and lower elasticities for prevention visits (-0.02) and emergency rooms (-0.04). Demand response is lower for children, in larger firms, among hourly waged employees, and for sicker people. Overall the method appears promising for estimating elasticities for highly disaggregated services although the approach does not work well on services that are very expensive or persistent.

We evaluated models using 457,000 people assigned to 436 primary care physician panels, and among 13,000 people in a distinct multipayer medical home implementation with commercially insured, Medicare, and Medicaid patients. {METHODS}: Each outcome is separately predicted from age, sex, and diagnoses. We define the {PCAL} outcome as a subset of all costs that proxies the bundled payment needed for comprehensive primary care. Other expected outcomes are used to establish targets against which actual performance can be fairly judged. We evaluate model performance using R(2)'s at patient and practice levels, and within policy-relevant subgroups. {RESULTS}: The {PCAL} model explains 67\% of variation in its outcome, performing well across diverse patient ages, payers, plan types, and provider specialties; it explains 72\% of practice-level variation. In 9 performance measures, the outcome-specific models explain 17\%-86\% of variation at the practice level, often substantially outperforming a generic score like the one used for full capitation payments in Medicare: for example, with grouped R(2)'s of 47\% versus 5\% for predicting "prescriptions for antibiotics of concern." {CONCLUSIONS}: Existing data can support the risk-adjusted bundled payment calculations and performance assessments needed to encourage desired transformations in primary care.}

This is accomplished within the nonparametric targeted learning framework, which incorporates ensemble machine learning. Previous literature studying the impact of medical conditions on health care spending has almost exclusively focused on parametric risk adjustment; thus, I compare my approach to parametric regression. {PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: My results demonstrate that multiple sclerosis, congestive heart failure, severe cancers, major depression and bipolar disorders, and chronic hepatitis are the most costly medical conditions on average per individual. These findings differed from those obtained using parametric regression. {CONCLUSIONS}: The literature may be underestimating the spending contributions of several medical conditions, which is a potentially critical oversight. If current methods are not capturing the true incremental effect of medical conditions, undesirable incentives related to care may remain.

Penalized linear regression represents a practical and incremental step forward that provides transparency and interpretability within the familiar regression framework. This study conducted an in-depth comparison of prediction performance of standard and penalized linear regression in predicting future health care costs in older adults. {METHODS} {AND} {FINDINGS}: This retrospective cohort study included 81,106 Medicare Advantage patients with 5 years of continuous medical and pharmacy insurance from 2009 to 2013. Total health care costs in 2013 were predicted with comorbidity indicators from 2009 to 2012. Using 2012 predictors only, {OLS} performed poorly (e.g., R2 = 16.3\%) compared to penalized linear regression models (R2 ranging from 16.8 to 16.9\%); using 2009-2012 predictors, the gap in prediction performance increased (R2:15.0\% versus 18.0-18.2\%). {OLS} with a reduced set of predictors selected by lasso showed improved performance (R2 = 16.6\% with 2012 predictors, 17.4\% with 2009-2012 predictors) relative to {OLS} without variable selection but still lagged behind the prediction performance of penalized regression. Lasso regression consistently generated prediction ratios closer to 1 across different levels of predicted risk compared to other models. {CONCLUSIONS}: This study demonstrated the advantages of using transparent and easy-to-interpret penalized linear regression for predicting future health care costs in older adults relative to standard linear regression. Penalized regression showed better performance than {OLS} in predicting health care costs. Applying penalized regression to longitudinal data increased prediction accuracy. Lasso regression in particular showed superior prediction ratios across low and high levels of predicted risk. Health care insurers, providers and policy makers may benefit from adopting penalized regression such as lasso regression for cost prediction to improve risk adjustment and population health management and thus better address the underlying needs and risk of the populations they serve.}

Healthcare claims from privately-insured {US} adults (2016-2017), and Census data were used for analysis. Data from 1.02 million adults were used for derivation, and data from 0.26 million to assess performance. Model performance was measured using coefficient of determination (R2), discrimination (C-statistic), and mean absolute error ({MAE}) for the overall population, and predictive ratio and net compensation for vulnerable subgroups. We provide 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) around each performance measure. {RESULTS}: Linear regression without {SDH} indicators achieved moderate determination (R2 0.327, 95\% {CI}: 0.300, 0.353), error (\$6992; 95\% {CI}: \$6889, \$7094), and discrimination (C-statistic 0.703; 95\% {CI}: 0.701, 0.705). {ML} without {SDH} indicators improved all metrics (R2 0.388; 95\% {CI}: 0.357, 0.420; error \$6637; 95\% {CI}: \$6539, \$6735; C-statistic 0.717; 95\% {CI}: 0.715, 0.718), reducing misestimation of cost by \$3.5 M per 10,000 members. Among people living in areas with high poverty, high wealth inequality, or high prevalence of uninsured, {SDH} indicators reduced underestimation of cost, improving the predictive ratio by 3\% (\~\$200/person/year). {CONCLUSIONS}: {ML} improved risk adjustment models and the incorporation of {SDH} indicators reduced underpayment in several vulnerable populations.}

Additionally, we compare the experience of Medicare Advantage and of employer-sponsored health insurance with managed care over the same time period. {FINDINGS}: Beneficiaries' access to private plans has been inconsistent over the program's history, with higher plan payments resulting in greater choice and enrollment and vice versa. But Medicare Advantage generally has cost more than the traditional Medicare program, an overpayment that has increased in recent years. {CONCLUSIONS}: Major changes in Medicare Advantage's payment rules are needed in order to simultaneously encourage the participation of private plans, the provision of high-quality care, and to save Medicare money. \copyright 2011 Milbank Memorial Fund.

One common approach is to emphasize a credible research design; we review results from two randomized experiments, as well as some quasi-experimental studies. This work has produced compelling evidence that moral hazard in health insurance exists-that is, individuals, on average, consume less healthcare when they are required to pay more for it out of pocket-as well as qualitative evidence about its nature. These studies alone, however, provide little guidance for forecasting healthcare spending under contracts not directly observed in the data. Therefore, a second and complementary approach is to develop an economic model that can be used out of sample. We note that modeling choices can be consequential: different economic models may fit the reduced form but deliver different counterfactual predictions. An additional role of the more descriptive analyses is therefore to provide guidance regarding model choice.}

abstract = {The distribution of health care payments to insurance plans has substantial consequences for social policy. Risk adjustment formulas predict spending in health insurance markets in order to provide fair benefits and health care coverage for all enrollees, regardless of their health status. Unfortunately, current risk adjustment formulas are known to underpredict spending for specific groups of enrollees leading to undercompensated payments to health insurers. This incentivizes insurers to design their plans such that individuals in undercompensated groups will be less likely to enroll, impacting access to health care for these groups. To improve risk adjustment formulas for undercompensated groups, we expand on concepts from the statistics, computer science, and health economics literature to develop new fair regression methods for continuous outcomes by building fairness considerations directly into the objective function. We additionally propose a novel measure of fairness while asserting that a suite of metrics is necessary in order to evaluate risk adjustment formulas more fully. Our data application using the {IBM} {MarketScan} Research Databases and simulation studies demonstrates that these new fair regression methods may lead to massive improvements in group fairness (eg, 98\%) with only small reductions in overall fit (eg, 4\%). \copyright 2019 The Authors.

abstract = {Risk adjustment for health plan payment is a bundled payment strategy in which payments are based on mathematical formulas that predict health plan obligations for spending on each enrollee. The risk adjustment formula quantifies the relationship between spending and explanatory variables called risk adjusters. The selection of risk adjusters involves tradeoffs between cost saving and selection incentives. Exogenous variables like age and sex that are independent of spending choices and utilization maximize cost-saving incentives but leave strong incentives for selection, while endogenous, more gameable variables that reflect utilization and taste choices may better reduce selection incentives but weaken cost control. Estimation requires selecting a population, the types of spending to be adjusted, an objective function, and choosing a statistical approach for estimation, for which machine learning is a promising direction. Implementation of risk adjustment formulas requires a choice of enrollee data, adjustments to deal with time lags, accommodation of other payment system features such as risk sharing and premiums, and specifying how funds are to be reallocated from the sources of funds selected.}

abstract = {In the 1990s many countries have chosen to use prospective payment arrangements for health plans (e.g., health insurers, sickness funds or {HMOs}) together with health plan competition, as a means of creating incentives to be cost conscious, while preserving quality, innovation and responsiveness to consumer preferences. Risk adjustment is an important mechanism for attenuating problems that threaten the effectiveness of this strategy for resource allocation in health care. Without adequate risk adjustment, competing health plans have incentives to avoid individuals with predictable losses and to select predictably profitable members. This selection and the resulting risk segmentation can have adverse effects in terms of access to care, quality of care and efficiency in the production of care.This chapter first provides a conceptual framework for thinking about risk adjustment. Second, it gives an overview of the progress developing risk adjustment models in recent years. Third, several forms of risk sharing are discussed, which can be used as a tool for reducing selection in case of imperfect risk adjustment. Fourth, an overview is given of the current practice of risk adjustment and risk sharing in 11 countries. Finally some directions for future research are discussed. In health care systems with a competitive health insurance market, governments or other sponsors (e.g. employers) often subsidize premiums to encourage enrolment. These subsidies are typically independent of plan choice leaving the absolute premium differences in place so as not to distort consumer choice of plan. Such subsidies do, however, change the relative premium differences across plans, which, according to theories from behavioral economics, can affect choice. Consumers might be sensitive to differences relative to a reference premium (\textquotedblleftrelative thinking\textquotedblright). Furthermore, consumers might be particularly sensitive to a reference premium of zero (\textquotedblleftzero-price effect\textquotedblright), a relevant range for some subsidized health insurance markets. This paper tests these ideas with two sources of evidence. We argue that observed equilibria in Germany and the U.S. Medicare Advantage markets are consistent with a powerful zero-price effect, resulting in an equilibrium focal pricing at zero. This contrasts with the Netherlands where equilibrium premiums are well above zero. In an empirical test using hypothetical questions in a web-based survey in these three countries, we also find evidence for both a relative thinking and a zero-price effect in the demand for health insurance. Our findings imply that well-designed subsidies can leverage relative thinking to increase demand elasticity for health plans. Creation of a powerful reference price (e.g., at zero), however, risks subverting price competition. The paper examines cream skimming behaviour by studying hospital transfers in a mixed public-private hospital system. A key innovation is the use of capacity utilization to identify cream skimming. We develop a dynamic model with uncertain patient arrivals and hospital capacity constraints to clarify the conditions under which a profit maximizing hospital will engage in patient selection by transferring \textquotelefthard\textquoteright patients\textemdashthose with severe/complex conditions\textemdashto free up capacity to accommodate \textquotelefteasy\textquoteright patients with few severe/complex conditions. Given finite capacity, public hospitals are strictly less likely to transfer patients than profit-motivated private hospitals at the same level of capacity. We test implications of the model using hospital administrative data from Victoria, Australia, and find empirical support for the cream skimming predictions of the model. This paper studies general health insurance markets and proposes a scheme of transfers among a regulator and insurers that discourages risk selection and promotes efficient competition. The proposed scheme conditions transfers on the ex post profits of insurers and requires the regulator to hold minimal information to implement it. Equilibrium exists and each equilibrium allocation is efficient in any environment with a finite number of types and states even if single-crossing is not satisfied. I argue that the proposed scheme features the characteristics of ex post risk adjustment. Risk-adjustment in resource allocation is commonly used for regional redistribution or for eliminating risk selection motives of multiple statutory health insurers. In the Czech Republic, revenue redistribution between health insurers takes place since the 1990′s. Since 2018, the risk-adjustment mechanism includes an adjustment for insured with chronic diseases using Pharmacy-based Cost Group ({PCG}) classification. In addition, retrospective compensation for very high cost patients has been strengthened.To provide an internationally relevant overview of the Czech risk-adjustment system. To assess the implication of the 2018 reform for health insurers and for the development of chronic care.The framework of the Health Reform Monitor is used to analyse the policy process. Data from Czech health insurers and Czech Ministry of Health are used to assess likely impact of the reform.The reform increases coverage of predictable individual health risks and combines prospective risk-rating with strengthened retrospective risk-sharing among insurers. The reform results in moderate changes in risk-adjusted allocations of individual insurers.The Czech experience with risk-adjustment reforms is relevant for countries with multiple health insurers as well as for countries with risk-adjusted regional redistribution mechanisms. Combining prospective risk factors of age, sex, and {PCGs} with retrospective compensation of expensive cases limits potential losses to a manageable level, also for small risk-pools. It reduces incentives for cream skimming based on health status, enables higher use of risk-sharing contracts, and incentivizes the development of disease management programs in the Czech Republic. The conventional method for developing health care plan payment systems uses observed data to study alternative algorithms and set incentives for the health care system. In this paper, we take a different approach and transform the input data rather than the algorithm, so that the data used reflect the desired spending levels rather than the observed spending levels. We present a general economic model that incorporates the previously overlooked two-way relationship between health plan payment and insurer actions. We then demonstrate our systematic approach for data transformations in two Medicare applications: underprovision of care for individuals with chronic illnesses and health care disparities by geographic income levels. Empirically comparing our method to two other common approaches shows that the \textquotedblleftside effects\textquotedblright of these approaches vary by context, and that data transformation is an effective tool for addressing misallocations in individual health insurance markets.}

abstract = {We describe the characteristics necessary for a plan for universal health insurance to find broad acceptance. Such a plan must represent incremental, not radical, change; must respect the preferences of voters, patients, and providers; must avoid major disruption in satisfactory existing arrangements; must avoid creating major windfall gains or losses; must avoid large-scale income redistribution; and must not be inflationary. Our proposal would create a framework that would encourage the efficient organization of care. Successful organizations would probably be those that attracted the loyalty and commitment of physicians, integrated insurance and the provision of care, and aligned the interests of doctors and patients toward high-quality, cost-effective care. The proposal's chief potential disadvantage would be its effect on the employment opportunities of low-wage workers, but this effect could be minimized. In addition, we discuss a proposal to mandate coverage by employers of full-time employees, legislation enacted recently in Massachusetts, high-risk pools, and the system followed in Canada, comparing each of these alternatives with our proposal.}

abstract = {The Italian National Healthcare Service relies on per capita allocation for healthcare funds, despite having a highly detailed and wide range of data to potentially build a complex risk-adjustment formula. However, heterogeneity in data availability limits the development of a national model. This paper implements and ealuates machine learning ({ML}) and standard risk-adjustment models on different data scenarios that a Region or Country may face, to optimize information with the most predictive model. We show that {ML} achieves a small but generally statistically insignificant improvement of adjusted R2 and mean squared error with fine data granularity compared to linear regression, while in coarse granularity and poor range of variables scenario no differences were observed. The advantage of {ML} algorithms is greater in the coarse granularity and fair/rich range of variables set and limited with fine granularity scenarios. The inclusion of detailed morbidity- and pharmacy-based adjustors generally increases fit, although the trade-off of creating adverse economic incentives must be considered. \copyright 2022 The Authors.

abstract = {Sources of disagreement about {accessThe} fair equality of opportunity account has important implications for the public policy debate about access to personal medical services. But to see what is useful and distinctive about the account, it will be necessary to look at the extensive and diverse empirical literature on access. My concern, however, is conceptual and moral, not empirical. I will not try to resolve disputes about numbers.The literature on equity of access is complex and confusing. Indeed, there is not consensus on what counts as \textquoteleftequitable access\textquoteright. There are three central reasons for divergence on this question. First, access is itself a complicated notion, a composite of many factors. Consequently, determining what counts as equality of access, let alone equity of access, is a non-trivial problem; moreover, in some cases considerations about equity already play a role in our judgements about equality. Second, health-care services are non-homogeneous. They have many functions, some more important, more basic, or more urgent than others. So, as I noted in Chapter 1, it is not possible to settle questions about equity of access until we have made it clear what the access is to. Are we worried about access to all the services offered in our health-care system? Or are we worried only about a key set of services, defined by reference to some central or basic function, regardless of their availability within our system? And how can we pick these out in the context of an evolving system and technology?}
