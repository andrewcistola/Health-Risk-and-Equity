# R programming statements for h222 data                                              
#                                                                                           
# This file contains programming statements needed to import the ASCII data                 
# file (.dat) into R. The R programming language has the capability to produce              
# appropriate standard errors for estimates from a survey with a complex sample             
# design such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).                               
#                                                       
# The input file is the ASCII data file (h222.dat) supplied in this PUF                
# release, which can be extracted from the .zip file supplied at the MEPS                   
# website: https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files.jsp                 
#                                                       
# This code imports the MEPS data into R as a data frame called 'h222'.            
#                                                       
# Note that additional packages are needed to successfully run this code. To                
# install these packages, run the 'install.packages' function (shown below).                
# Once installed, the packages can be called using the 'library' function.                  
# Packages only need to be installed once, but they must be called using the                
# 'library' function every time a new R session is started.                                 
#                                                       
# Two options are available to run this code:                                               
#                                                       
#  1. Copy and paste the code into an interactive R session.                                
#                                                       
#     The user must first download the ASCII (.dat) file from the MEPS website              
#     and save it to a local directory, which must be defined in the                        
#     'meps_path' variable below. In this example, the local directory is                   
#     called 'C:/MEPS'. Note that the path structure will differ on Mac and PC.             
#                                                       
#                                                       
#  2. Call this code directly from an interactive R session.                                
#                                                       
#  (a) If the ASCII (.dat) file has already been downloaded from the MEPS                   
#         website and saved to a local directory, the following code can be run             
#         (after re-defining the 'meps_path' variable to point to the location              
#         of the h222.dat file.)                                   
#                                                       
#     meps_path <- "C:/MEPS/h222.dat"                             
#     source("https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data/pufs/h222/h222ru.txt")
#     head(h222) # view data                                       
#                                                       
#  (b) Alternatively, the ASCII (.dat) file can be downloaded directly from                 
#         the MEPS website. The following code can be used to download and                  
#         import the h222 data into R without having to manually download,             
#         unzip, and store the file on your local computer.                         
#                                                       
#           url <- "https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_files/pufs/h222dat.zip" 
#           download.file(url, temp <- tempfile())                              
#                                                       
#     meps_path <- unzip(temp, exdir = tempdir())                               
#     source("https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data/pufs/h222/h222ru.txt")
#                                                       
#           unlink(temp)  # Unlink to delete temporary file                         
#                                                       
#           head(h222) # view data                                 
#                                                       
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------             
                                                        
# DEFINE 'meps_path' -----------------------------------------------------------            
# 'meps_path' should point to the file path of the ASCII file (h222.dat)               
# Here, the 'exists' function checks whether meps_path is already defined. This             
# feature is useful if calling this file from an external source.                           
if(!exists("meps_path"))  meps_path = "C:/MEPS/h222.dat"
