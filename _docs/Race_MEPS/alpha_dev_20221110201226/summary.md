# Health, Risk, and Equity

### About
Previous research have shown signficiant under-utilization of ambulatory care and signficiantly lower costs among black insured individuals 18-64 from 2014-2018. (doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.17383) If these differences persist through the ACA risk adjustment program, under-utilization represents an arbitrage opportunity for insurance providers in the individual market. This would represent how a history of systematic racism and barriers to care could be used for cost-containment measures with the beenfits of overall lower health care costs transferred among the larger population. Health equity efforts should be focused on neutralizing arbitrage opporunties based on defacto discrimination and instead incentivize issuers to address disparities in access to care. With the addition of race and zip code to the EDGE server in 2025, CMS will have the ability to reform the ACA risk adjustmenr program to improve these disparities. The purpose of this study is to identify how the ACA Risk Adjustment program interacts with known health disparities in health care utilization among raical groups. This study uses publcily available data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) from Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files.jsp) from 2018 to 2021 to identify differences in risk that can be attributed to racial group independent of other factors and whether the ACA risk adjustment program excacerbates these diferences. Evidence from this study can identify how racial data can be used by CMS to promote health equity within the ACA marketplaces.
