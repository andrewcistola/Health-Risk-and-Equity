Health, Risk, and Equity

Built repository to prepare for primary data collection. Will start by creating a script to collect and clean data for regression model and for calculating risk scores. 
After that, calculate silver level risk scores along with predictive rations by racial group. 
Then, build a regression model for paid claims cost using risk score and other ACARA factors.
Then use randomforests, XGBoost, and ridge regression to predict with a wider range of variables.
Assess progress from there.
Do all these steps first in R to get doen quick, then move to other options. 

Need to get in the habit of creating virtual environments.
Here is a process to use:

1) Create venv in directory
Set-Location <path to project>
python -m venv venv

2) Activate
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

3) Update pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

4) Install libraries
pip list
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scipy
pip install statsmodels
pip install matplotlib
pip install geopandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
Or 
pip install -r requirements.txt

5) Export dependencies
pip freeze > requirements.txt

Need to figure out how to do same thing with R or just use anaconda.

Found source for consolidated individual files along with health encounter data.
https://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files_results.jsp?cboDataYear=All&cboDataTypeY=2%2CHousehold+Event+File&buttonYearandDataType=Search&cboPufNumber=All
Downloaded individual file R scripts along with PDF versions of their documentation from 2020 to 2017
Used file naming convention AHRQ_MEPS_ASCII_YEAR_SUBJECT where subject is either HOUSE for household file or OFFICE, OUTPATIENT, HOSPITAL, ER, OTHER for visit files.
Still need to download all the visit files from 2020 to 2017.
Once downloaded, I can build a sqlite db to access all of the files using a setup_import_db R script.

Sucessfully udpated virtual environment for project. Updated primary py script for setup_clean.

14:28
Organized alpha dev scripts for R and Python for the Race project. 
Added comments to REAMDE to keep project updated
Added summary and results files to python setup script (steill need to figure out best way to us ein R)
Need to make GitHub Repo and identify backup option.

14:44 
Added xlsxwriter to libraries and reexported requirements (see log above).
Setup process complete for python.

16:32
Incorporated method for sharing variables between R and Python.
Next steps are to add GitHuib repo and gather 

16:44 
Added git repo using following steps 


1a) Initialize local repo
git init
.gitignore

1b) Large files
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.csv"




2) Confirm SSH setup
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "andrewcistola@pm.me"
Add to Github
3) Create git repo on Github.com

3) Add remote 
git remote add origin https://github.com/andrewcistola/Health-Risk-and-Equity.git

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories


1c) Commit changes
git add -A
git commit -a -m 'Repo setup'


4) Push chnages
git push -f origin main
