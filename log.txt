Built repository to prepare for primary data collection. Will start by creating a script to collect and clean data for regression model and for calculating risk scores. 
After that, calculate silver level risk scores along with predictive rations by racial group. 
Then, build a regression model for paid claims cost using risk score and other ACARA factors.
Then use randomforests, XGBoost, and ridge regression to predict with a wider range of variables.
Assess progress from there.
Do all these steps first in R to get doen quick, then move to other options. 

Need to get in the habit of creating virtual environments.
Here is a process to use:

1) Create venv in directory
Set-Location <path to project>
python -m venv venv

2) Activate
python venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

3) Update pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

4) Install libraries
pip list
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib

Or 

pip install -r requirements.txt


5) Export dependencies
pip freeze > requirements.txt
