Health, Risk, and Equity

Built repository to prepare for primary data collection. Will start by creating a script to collect and clean data for regression model and for calculating risk scores. 
After that, calculate silver level risk scores along with predictive rations by racial group. 
Then, build a regression model for paid claims cost using risk score and other ACARA factors.
Then use randomforests, XGBoost, and ridge regression to predict with a wider range of variables.
Assess progress from there.
Do all these steps first in R to get doen quick, then move to other options. 

Need to get in the habit of creating virtual environments.
Here is a process to use:

1) Create venv in directory
Set-Location <path to project>
python -m venv venv

2) Activate
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

3) Update pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

4) Install libraries
pip list
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scipy
pip install statsmodels
pip install matplotlib
pip install geopandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
Or 
pip install -r requirements.txt

5) Export dependencies
pip freeze > requirements.txt

Need to figure out how to do same thing with R or just use anaconda.

Found source for consolidated individual files along with health encounter data.
https://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files_results.jsp?cboDataYear=All&cboDataTypeY=2%2CHousehold+Event+File&buttonYearandDataType=Search&cboPufNumber=All
Downloaded individual file R scripts along with PDF versions of their documentation from 2020 to 2017
Used file naming convention AHRQ_MEPS_ASCII_YEAR_SUBJECT where subject is either HOUSE for household file or OFFICE, OUTPATIENT, HOSPITAL, ER, OTHER for visit files.
Still need to download all the visit files from 2020 to 2017.
Once downloaded, I can build a sqlite db to access all of the files using a setup_import_db R script.

12:22
Sucessfully udpated virtual environment for project. Updated primary py script for setup_clean.

14:28
Organized alpha dev scripts for R and Python for the Race project. 
Added comments to REAMDE to keep project updated
Added summary and results files to python setup script (steill need to figure out best way to us ein R)
Need to make GitHub Repo and identify backup option.

14:44 
Added xlsxwriter to libraries and reexported requirements (see log above).
Setup process complete for python.

16:32
Incorporated method for sharing variables between R and Python.
Next steps are to add GitHuib repo and gather 

17:44 
Added git repo using following steps 

1a) Initialize local repo
git init
.gitignore

1b) Large files
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.csv"

2) Confirm SSH setup
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "andrewcistola@pm.me"
Add to Github
3) Create git repo on Github.com

3) Add remote 
git remote add origin https://github.com/andrewcistola/Health-Risk-and-Equity.git
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

4) Push changes
git add -A
git commit -a -m 'Repo setup'
git push -f origin main

Steps for staritng new session:

Started session by 
1) Open PS and bash terminal in project folder

2) Activate environment
> venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

3) fetch head from remote 
$ Git pull origin main

4) Run Setup scripts 
RACE_MEPS_setup_alpha_dev.py
RACE_MEPS_setup_alpha_dev.r

5) Get to work

If terminals crash

1) Open bash terminal to project directory

2) Run setup scripts again

13:16
Finished import to SQLite db for all household scripts. ran into a lot of issues but have a script that I am confiudent will work.
Need to add scripts for visit level data.
Then I can run end to end to debug.
Then build a cleaning script in python where I pull the needed variables and generate an analytical file.

14:02
Downloaded 2018-2020 event files.
Adding to import script.
Moved R script and documentaiton to single year folders in docs subrepo

15:49
Updated organization of repo to use tmp and wrap differewntly and have topic/subject specific directories (with subdirectories for each version and time) within each standard subrepo.
Runnming import script to see if it works all the way through.
If so then push changes.
Next stapes are to start pulling and cleaning

18:30
Wrote cleaning script for person and event files. However I will need to gather and link the condition files. 
Also, need to identify whether i will ahve enough info for risk scores
Next steps are to gather files, update the import script and then add to celaning script.

22:03
Finished cleaning script and data is now available to calculate risk scores.
Will have to mopdify Table 3 to use only first three ICD10 code indicators.

2022 Nov 11 12:28
Finished script for calculating all variablers for analytical files.
Assembled  and exported analytical files for a regresison model (Q1) and for a machine learning model (Q2) 
Still need to calculate risk scores from DIY files (listed steps in calc sript)
ICD10 and visit count available as proxy for risk score for preliminary analysis. 
Next steps are to build regression models in R and machine learning models in python
Then vizualize results and report.

Added script to model kitigawa Oaxaca blinder and got preliminary results using hand sleected variables
Found expected result when log transfomred Y.
Likely a few high spenders in non-white group. 
This is promising, add more models next.
