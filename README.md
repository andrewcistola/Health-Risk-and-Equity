# Health, Risk, and Equity
Addressing Health Equity through the Permanent Risk Adjustment Program mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 â€‹

### About
Previous research have shown signficiant under-utilization of ambulatory care and signficiantly lower costs among black insured individuals 18-64 from 2014-2018. (1) <br>
If these differences persist through the ACA risk adjustment program, under-utilization represents an arbitrage opportunity for insurance providers in the individual market. <br>
This would represent how a history of systematic racism and barriers to care could be used for cost-containment measures with the beenfits of overall lower health care costs transferred among the larger population.<br>
Health equity efforts should be focused on neutralizing arbitrage opporunties based on defacto discrimination and instead incentivize issuers to address disparities in access to care.<br>
With the addition of race and zip code to the EDGE server in 2025, CMS will have the ability to reform the ACA risk adjustmenr program to improve these disparities<br>
The purpose of this study is to identify how the ACA Risk Adjustment program interacts with known health disparities in health care utilization among raical groups.<br>
Evidence from this study can identify 1) Whether there is evidence that the phenomenon is present in the program 2) Avenues for reforming the program to eliminate the phenomonen<br>
This analysis serves to fulfill part of the the requirements for the PhD in Public Health-Heath Services Research at the University of Florida.
